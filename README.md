MirrorOS is a lightweight user interface designed specifically for Magic Mirrors and transparent glass touch screens. The UI is built entirely on web development languages and is meant to be ran inside a headless web browser. MirrorOS supports LeapMotion as a touch input.
In the future, MirrorOS will move to using Electron.

Current features
  - Leap Motion Support to substitute touch screens
  - Three-point calibration of the Leap Motion sensor to create a touch plane
  - Draggable placeholder widgets

To implement
  - Support for apps, widgets and extentions
  - Providing an API for developers to extend the UI
  - Communication with nearby devices (getting notification from phone, connecting to bluetooth speakers)
  - Support for Air Play and other video streaming platforms to display content on the Magic Mirror/Display
